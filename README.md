## Problem
Based on a puzzle made by [Quanta Magazine](https://hyperjumps.quantamagazine.org/). This puzzle is a numbers game where you are given a set and return a sequence that follows certain rule (explained on the website in great detail).

## Program
This program is made to solve this problem effecietly (the naive solution can be found in the test.py file - warning it is disgusting). The more effecient solution uses a dictionary based approch and a couple of mathmatical shortcuts and effeciency best practices. It is still very lacking so if you see improvement potential, feel free to raise an issue.
